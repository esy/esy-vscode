# DEPRECATED

Esy is nicely handled by most ocaml vscode extensions now. [vscode-merlin](https://github.com/arrowresearch/vscode-merlin) is in progress.
If you just want to use the esy.json schema, please [see here](https://github.com/esy/esy-schema) instead

# esy

## Features

For now, this extension only extends the validation schema for package.json by adding esy-specific fields.
